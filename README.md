🖥️ Process Management in Python
This project demonstrates key Operating System process management concepts using Python, including process creation, execution, zombies & orphans, process inspection, and scheduling with priorities.

📌 Tasks Overview
Task 1: Process Creation Utility

Create N child processes using os.fork()

Each child prints:

Its PID

Its Parent PID

A custom message

The parent waits for all children using os.wait()

Task 2: Command Execution using exec()

Modify Task 1 so that each child executes a Linux command (ls, date, ps, etc.)

Use either:

os.execvp()

subprocess.run()

Demonstrates how processes replace their execution image with a new program

Task 3: Zombie & Orphan Processes

Zombie Process → Fork a child but skip wait() in the parent

Orphan Process → Parent exits before the child finishes

Check with:

ps -el | grep defunct
Task 4: Inspecting Process Info from /proc

Take a PID as input and read:

Process name, state, memory usage → /proc/[pid]/status

Executable path → /proc/[pid]/exe

Open file descriptors → /proc/[pid]/fd

Task 5: Process Prioritization

Create multiple CPU-intensive child processes

Assign different nice() values

Observe execution order and scheduler impact

Happy Learning!!
